# NoSQL_Benchmarking
NoSQL Databases on Single Board Computer: A Comparison Study
In this repository, the performance of MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis has been evaluated on Raspberry Pi 4 model B. The record count has been fixed at 100000 and also the operation count has been fixed to 100000. But the client thread has been changed. The values of the client threads that have been used are  80, 400, 2000, and 10000. 

Note: Also the tests has been performed for the client thread of 16 but the experiment results are available in another repository with this link https://github.com/SaraDanaKablTalabani/master_thesis/tree/main.
